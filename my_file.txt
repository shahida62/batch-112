A basic calculator program in Python can be created without explicitly using a for loop for the core arithmetic operations.
 Instead, if/elif/else statements are typically used to determine the operation based on user input.
 However, a for loop can be used if you want to perform a series of calculations on a set of numbers or if you want to implement a calculator that processes a list of operationsA basic calculator program in Python can be created without explicitly using a for loop for the core arithmetic operations.
